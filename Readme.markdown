# Clock.saver

Just a little Mac screensaver inspired by the [Braun watches](http://braun-clocks.com/watches). You pick a model and style. Here’s a screenshot:

## Installation

**[Download the latest release](https://github.com/soffes/clock-saver/releases).** Unzip and double-click.


## Preferences

Don’t forget to check out “Screen Saver Options…” in System Preferences. You can change the model and style to your liking.


## Building

Xcode 7b3 is required since Clock.saver is written in Swift 2.


## Watch Faces

The following models are implemented:

* [BN0021 Range](http://braun-clocks.com/watch/BN0021BKBKG)
    * BN0021BKBKG: Black
    * BN0021WHBRG: Brown
* [BN0032 Range](http://braun-clocks.com/watch/BN0032)
    * BN0032WHBKG: White
    * BN0032BKBKG: Black
* [BN0111 Sports Range](http://braun-clocks.com/watch/BN0111)
    * BN0111WHBLG: Blue
    * BN0111BKORG: Orange
    * BN0111WHGYG: Grey
    * BN0111BKBKG: Black
    * BN0111BKLGYG: Light grey

Eventually, I'd love to have them all implemented. Here's my [progress](Coverage.markdown).

Enjoy.
